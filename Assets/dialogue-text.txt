--GRASSLAND--

Opening text:
(Today's the big day!)
(I'd better hurry, don't want to be late!)

Attempting to cross the street:
(Crossing here could be dangerous.)
(I should find a crosswalk.)

After pushing the button, and after the "electrocution" music has played:
(Guess that wasn't the safe thing to do after all.)
(I think I'm dead, but now where am I supposed to go?)

If you attempt to cross the street after dying:
(Technically, I've already crossed over.)
(So what's the point?)

If you attempt to push the button again after dying:
(Yeah, right. Like I'm going to do that again.)

--TUNNEL--

After going through the portal:
(Whoa, that was weird.)
(Where am I?)

When attempting to breach the southern barrier early:
(It says "DO NOT PASS.")

When knocking on the door:
(It's locked.)
(But I can hear someone inside...)

When checking out dead flowers:
(Looks like they could use some water.)

When picking up the watering can:
YOU GOT THE WATERING CAN.

After watering all of the flowers:
Oh...hello. Thanks for watering my flowers.
I'm the grim reaper, but...
I've been a little depressed lately.
That's why I didn't come to get you after you died.
Things are kind of falling apart around here.
It'd be nice to have some help...

--INSIDE THE HOUSE--

-MAIN ROOM-

Initial Reaper text:
Feel free to make yourself at home.
Sorry about the mess...

When investigating a dust pile/cobwebs:
(This room could really stand a sweeping...)

When picking up the broom:
YOU GOT THE BROOM.

After sweeping up the dust/cobwebs:
Thanks for sweeping up, but...
The spiders can't catch any flies without their webs.
Do you think you can catch some?


-KITCHEN-

When checking the jar of honey:
(This jar of honey has some flies stuck in it.)
(*Gag*)

When checking the bread:
(I bet a sandwich would cheer him up.)
(But I'll need some more ingredients...)

When picking up lettuce/cheese/tomato:
(This would go great in a sandwich!)

When picking up the last ingredient:
(I've got everything I need for a great sandwich!)

When making the sandwich:
YOU GOT THE SANDWICH.
Wow! You made that just for me? Thanks!

-SUNROOM-

When interacting with a grown plant:
Plants with teeth? Spooky!

After watering all of the plants:
Thanks for watering my plants!
...but watch those fingers. Heh heh heh...

-FLIES-

When checking a fly without the jar:
(I don't have anything to catch it with!)

When picking up the honey jar:
YOU GOT THE JAR OF HONEY.
(There's already some flies stuck in here.)
(Gross...)

When catching a fly:
(I caught a fly!)

When catching the fourth fly:
(I caught a fly!)
(If I can find just one more...)

When catching the last fly:
(I caught a fly!)
(Man, this thing is huge!)
(The spiders should be happy now!)

-BEDROOM-

Talking to reaper:
Oh...hey...
Sorry things are such a mess...


-TASKS COMPLETE-

Initial Reaper text:
Wow, you really helped me out!
Sorry I've been dropping the ball on helping dead folks.
Let's get you to the great beyond!

Once warped to the gate:
Well, here we are! You're free to pass through to dimensions unknown.
Unless you felt like staying a little longer...

When re-entering the house:
Oh, you want to stay and hang out? That's great!
I'll make us some sandwiches! I hope you like fly honey...
